### Project Title
US Bikeshare data analysis with Python

### Description
This projects investigates certain user behaviors about bicycle sharing systems.
The data was provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), North America's bike share leader.

The used tables have already been filtered to show only the entries of 2017, between January and June.

The columns of each table are:

 - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
 - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01   00:20:53)
 - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 - Start Station (e.g.: Broadway & Barry Ave)
 - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The extended tables are available at:

 1. [Capital Bikeshare's webpage](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)
 2. [Citi Bike's webpage](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

The source code consists of the following operations in order:

 1. Command line user interface, asking for advanced filtering
 2. Loading the data from .csv files
 3. Running analysis on data
 4. Displaying the raw data if needed

### Files used
Source code:    bikeshare.py
Readme file:    README.md
Additional data files to be used: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washing.csv
